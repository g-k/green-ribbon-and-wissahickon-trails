A longer flat hike accessible by regional train following the Wissahickon River back into Philly.

[The Green Ribbon Trail](http://www.wvwa.org/greenribbontrail/) runs into the Montgomery County Wissahickon Trail and almost abuts the [Philadelphia Country Wissahickon Trail](http://fow.org/visit-the-park/).

Sunrise at 7:02 AM and Sunset 6:36 at PM left almost 12 hours of daylight.

Took the Lansdale/Doylestown Line to the North Wales stop (conductor prevented me from getting off at North Hills). Arrived at 8:35.

I walked South to the wrong end of the train platform (don't do that) then took Beaver St. and N. Sumneytown Pike around the Merck campus.  At the interseciont with Parkside Place there's a crosswalk with a button.

The trailhead is past the Upper Gwynedd municipal buildings: 



Stopped at the [El Limon](https://goo.gl/maps/LLkWGNEZ5g52) in Ambler for lunch.  Ate a gigantic al pastor burrito con mole the size of two large clenched fists.

 

* the Montgomery County Wissahickon trail is not the same thing as the one in Philadelphia County 
* started getting dark early in the gorge 4pm, but street lights turned on (on Forbidden Drive)
* the bridge over Stent on Ave. has no shoulder recommend climbing on top of the barrier
* broken glass in trail watch your dog's feet
* mostly paved south of the turnpike
* more trash in Philly (but also more people)
* prefer the orange trail

Don't follow the creek after crossing W. Valley Green Rd. (avoid the Flourtown spur)

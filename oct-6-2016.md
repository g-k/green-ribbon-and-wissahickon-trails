A longer flat hike accessible by regional train following the Wissahickon River back into Philly.

[The Green Ribbon Trail](http://www.wvwa.org/greenribbontrail/) runs into the Montgomery County Wissahickon Trail and almost abuts the [Philadelphia Country Wissahickon Trail](http://fow.org/visit-the-park/).

Sunrise at 7:02 AM and Sunset 6:36 at PM leaves almost 12 hours of daylight.

Took the Lansdale/Doylestown Line to the North Wales stop (conductor prevented me from getting off at North Hills). Arrived at 8:35.



Stopped at the [El Limon](https://goo.gl/maps/LLkWGNEZ5g52) in Ambler for lunch.  Ate a gigantic al pastor burrito con mole the size of two large clenched fists.

 

* the Montgomery County Wissahickon trail is not the same thing as the one in Philadelphia County 
* started getting dark early in the gorge 4pm, but street lights turned on (on Forbidden Drive)
* the bridge over Stent on Ave. has no shoulder recommend climbing on top of the barrier
* broken glass in trail watch your dog's feet
* mostly paved south of the turnpike
* more trash in Philly (but also more people)
* prefer the orange trail

Don't follow the creek after crossing W. Valley Green Rd. (avoid the Flourtown spur)
